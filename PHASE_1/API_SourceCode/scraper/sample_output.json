The proclamation comes days after a Solano County woman tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The woman first admitted herself to a hospital in Vacaville and was taken to the UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento as her condition worsened. She was not tested immediately, as she did not meet the existing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for COVID-19, according to a statement from the hospital. On Wednesday, the CDC confirmed her coronavirus test came back positive. Her family and coworkers are currently under quarantine, officials said in a news conference Thursday. Officials are still trying to determine if anyone else was exposed to the patient.  | MORE | Coronavirus by the Numbers: California and beyond Dr. Bela Matyas, with the Solano County Health and Social Services, said they are changing their approach to the virus from containment to control.  \u201cAt this point here in Solano County, we\u2019re transitioning from trying to contain the disease to more of a mitigation approach. We recognize that if we do have community spread, that it becomes necessary to consider more aggressive protection of our critical resources,\u201d Matyas said.  The woman\u2019s coronavirus case is possibly the first instance of community virus spread, as she had \u201cno known exposure to the virus through travel or close contact with a known infected individual,\u201d according to the California Department of Public Health.

They all showed the same symptoms, said Md Mejbahul Hasan Chowdhury, an assistant director at the hospital. \u201cThis psychological condition is not rare.\u201d Chowdhury described the condition as mass hysteria, a sudden outbreak affecting a group of persons, characterised by excitement or anxiety, irrational behaviour or beliefs, or inexplicable symptoms of illness. He hoped the patients would be able to recover and return home by Sunday. \n \n \n\n \n \n\nRumours spread in the town that the hospitalised workers were infected with the coronavirus. Some panicked patients left the hospital as well.     \u201cThey returned after being assured that it was not the coronavirus,\u201d Chowdhury said. Golden Timing is a unit of Evergreen Products BD Ltd, which is owned by a Chinese national, officials said. Md Ferdous Alam, deputy general manager at Evergreen Products, said the workers were not seriously ill. \u201cWe arranged their treatment and shut the factory.\u201d Alam also said the factory does not use any chemical that can cause illness. Sima Rani, 20, and Nipa Roy, 19, were among the first affected by mass hysteria on the floor of 800 workers, and complained of headache. They said they had also vomited and fainted. \u201cI feel much better now after treatment,\u201d Nipa Roy said. \n \n \n\nAnother worker, Hasina Begum, 20, said all the workers left the factory out of panic as some of them fell ill.   The government\u2019s disease control agency IEDCR has warned against spreading rumours about the coronavirus, especially on social media. Rumours will jeopardise efforts to prevent an outbreak in Bangladesh, the IEDCR says. The authorities in Tangail forcefully hospitalised a returnee from Singapore on Feb 16 even though he did not show symptoms as fears of the coronavirus deepened following infections of five Bangladeshis in the city state. A woman in Satkhira died of a heart attack on Feb 11 reportedly after she panicked on rumours that her son had been diagnosed with the coronavirus.   \n\n\nMore stories\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nChild dies, 22

There are now eight cases linked to the e-learning solutions company at Science Park II that emerged as a new coronavirus cluster on Friday. Of the new cases, two are Singaporeans, one is a Malaysian and the other is a Filipino. All have no recent travel history to China, or to Daegu city and Cheongdo county in South Korea. The new infections bring the total number of confirmed cases here to 102.\u00a0Meanwhile, three more patients have been discharged, MOH said. Three of the four new cases are linked to Case 93, a 38-year-old employee of Wizlearn Technologies.\u00a0 The first, Case 99, is a 27-year-old Singaporean man who\u00a0reported onset of symptoms on Feb 21. He sought treatment at a general practitioner (GP) clinic on Feb 25, and Pioneer Polyclinic on Friday, when he was identified by MOH as a close contact of Case 93 and referred to the\u00a0National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on the same day and immediately isolated.

The 35-year-old male retail worker had dengue fever and the new disease known as Covid-19, Suwannachai Wattanayingcharoenchai, director-general of the Department of Disease Control, said in a briefing Sunday. \"This was a case of local transmission, and he was at risk because he had exposure to Chinese tourists,\" he said. The patient had been hospitalised since Feb 16 at a private hospital and transferred to Bamrasnardura Infectious Diseases Institute\u00a0and died on Saturday after multiple organ failure. The Public Health Ministry is still looking into the role played by the coronavirus in the fatality, Dr Suwannachai said. Tests for the coronavirus came back negative since Feb 16 but \u201cthe damage was already done to his body\u201d from the earlier bout of infection by the new disease, said Tawee Chotpitayasunondh, the department adviser. Thiravat Hemachudha, chief of the emerging disease centre of Chulalongkorn Hospital, on Sunday morning posted on his Facebook page that the man died at 6.25pm on Saturday, Feb 29.\u00a0 The Department of Disease Control\u00a0said another patient was in serious condition at Bamrasnaradura and doctors at the institute are closely monitoring the patient. The department repeated a warning on Sunday that any persons suspected of contracting\u00a0the virus are required to contact public health officials within three hours, according to the dangerous communicable disease announcement that took effect on Sunday. The announcement, signed by Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul and published in the Royal Gazette on Saturday, also gave authorities more power to combat the spread of the virus. Almost 3,000 people have died from the infection, mostly in its epicentre China. Thailand has reported 42 cases of infection, with 30 of those discharged. An Indochinese tiger has been found in Kanchanaburi's Salak Phra wildlife sanctuary, the first to be found in the area, according to the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation (DNP). The Agricultural Land Reform Office (Alro) has unveiled a plan to allocate Sor Por Kor land in Ratchaburi province's Chom Bung district, including 682 rai previously occupied by Palang Pracharath Party MP Pareena Kraikupt, to landless farmers.

Here are the latest updates:\u00a0 Angola will prohibit the entry of citizens from China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, Nigeria, Egypt and Algeria, if they travel directly from those countries as a precaution, official news agency ANGOP reported. The restriction would not apply to citizens that had travelled via a third country, the report said. The Scottish government reported its first case of coronavirus. The patient, who is a resident of the Tayside area, had recently travelled from northern Italy, the government said. The opening race of the MotoGP season in Qatar on March 8 was cancelled because of travel restrictions imposed on passengers from Italy, MotoGP said. \"Italy clearly plays a vital role in the championship and in the MotoGP class - both on track and off - and therefore the decision has been taken to cancel premier class competition,\" a statement said. The Moto2 and Moto3 categories will still race due to those teams and riders already being in Qatar for testing there last week. Finland confirmed its sixth case of the coronavirus after three new cases were diagnosed. Two cases - a child and a pensioner - had been in close contact with a woman who was diagnosed with the virus on Friday after a visit to northern Italy, the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare said. The trio were all in home isolation. About 130 people in the Helsinki area who had been in contact with the child including classmates, teachers and members of the child's football team have protectively been placed in home quarantine.

Azar told ABC that surveillance testing of flu-like symptoms was underway in key cities, including San Francisco, but he hoped to expand the testing across the country. He said the virus is likely to spread in the US, but it is uncertain how large the outbreak could become. Nigerian authorities have been in contacted with around 100 people who may have been exposed to an Italian man who is the country's first coronavirus patient, the Lagos state health commissioner said. \"It is around 100 people but that number is increasing every minute,\" Akin Abayomi said in a telephone interview with Reuters. He said some of the people travelled to other states in Nigeria or went to Europe.  Lebanon's health ministry said three more people tested positive for coronavirus after arriving from Iran, bringing the total in the country to 10. The three patients, who had been in isolation at home, were quarantined at a Beirut hospital after showing symptoms, the ministry said in a statement. Lebanon closed schools this week and halted flights for non-residents from countries with outbreaks, namely China, Iran, Italy and South Korea. There have been 12 new cases of coronavirus in the UK, bringing the total to 35, according to British health authorities. Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said in a statement on Twitter that three of those who tested positive were close contacts of a known case.

Fears overs the impact of the coronavirus outbreak has hit the stock markets in the oil-rich Gulf countries. All of the seven exchanges in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which were closed Friday and Saturday for the Muslim weekend, were hit as oil prices dropped below $50 a barrel. So far, Gulf states have reported at least 115 cases. Pollution levels over China have declined significantly, US space agency NASA says, partly due to the economic slowdown following the coronavirus outbreak. Satellite images shared by NASA show falling levels of nitrogen dioxide. The gas is emitted by motor vehicles, power plants and industrial facilities. In South Korea, authorities have reported 210 new cases on Sunday afternoon. Earlier on Sunday, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 376 cases and one death linked to the virus. The country's total number of infections stands at 3,736.

To the relief of animal lovers, authorities said there was no evidence yet that the virus could be transmitted to man's best friend. Churches were closed in South Korea on Sunday, many holding services online instead, according to Reuters. In the capital, Seoul, about a dozen worshippers were turned away from the Yoido Full Gospel Church, which put a sermon for its 560,000 followers on YouTube, filmed with a small choir instead of the usual 200 members and 60-strong orchestra. \"I had heard there would be no service, but just came to check as I live nearby, but yes, it is so empty,\" said one of them, Song Young-koo, as he left South Korea's biggest church. \"It's a wise decision to do it online, since the virus would easily spread at mass gatherings and churches can be no exception.\" For the first time in its 236-year history, South Korea's Catholic church decided to halt mass at more than 1,700 locations nationwide. Buddhist temples have also called off events. Thailand has recorded its first fatality in the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters reported, citing Suwanchai Wattanayingcharoen, director-general of the Department of Disease Control. The 35-year-old man also had dengue fever, Suwanchai told a news conference on Sunday. More details are emerging about Armenia's coronavirus patient. The 29-year-old citizen returned to Armenia from Iran on Friday and went to a doctor because he was feeling unwell, Reuters said, citing Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan's Facebook page. \"He is now in good condition,\" Pashinyan said, adding that authorities planned to isolate those who had been in contact with him.

The man's wife also caught the virus, but is in stable condition, authorities said. Australia has reported 25 cases of coronavirus.

Three of the new cases in England were linked to a man from Surrey, who was the first to be infected within the UK.  It comes after Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the UK was still in the \"containment\" phase of the outbreak.  He said the government contingency plans, which will be published this week, included banning big events. The Scottish government confirmed its first case on Sunday evening. It said the patient was receiving treatment in isolation in hospital. Three of the new cases revealed on Sunday were close contacts of the man from Surrey, who was announced as testing positive on Friday. They included another person from Surrey and two people from West Sussex who were all \"part of an adult family cluster\", Public Health England said. Another new case from Essex had \"no relevant travel\" and it was unclear how they had contracted the virus. The remaining eight had visited affected areas - six to Italy, and two to Iran. They were from London, West Yorkshire, Greater Manchester, Hertfordshire and Gloucestershire, and included: Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, said all of the newly identified cases were being investigated and health officials had begun tracing anyone who had close contact with them. As of 09:00 GMT on Sunday, the Department of Health said a total of 11,750 people had been tested in the UK. The latest positive tests come after three more cases were confirmed in England on Saturday. One of those was a member of staff at St Mary's School in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, the primary school said on Sunday.  That follows another school - Willow Bank Infant School in Woodley, Berkshire - confirming that one of its staff had been infected. The government has said no tactics will be \"off the table\" as part of its plan to contain the virus in the UK. Mr Hancock told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show an emergency \"battle plan\", drawn up for the \"worst case scenario\", includes banning big events, closing schools and dissuading people from using public transport. The health secretary said there were four phases to the plan: Currently, the UK is in the \"containment\" phase - which health leaders say may still be sufficient.  But the next phase could see broader \"social distancing\" measures. Matt Hancock would have been warned there was a strong likelihood there would be a jump in cases when he did his interview for the Andrew Marr Show. A few hours later the biggest increase in a single day was announced, with 12 more people testing positive for the coronavirus. That's why he went further than before in setting out possible government plans to tackle an accelerated spread of the virus around the UK if that happens.  School closures, cancellations of major public events and moves to persuade people to work at home are clearly options being actively considered.  The strategy seems to be to warn that difficult measures may be needed while focusing on trying to contain the spread of the virus. As one government source put it, \"prepare for the worst, work for the best\". Labour shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Mr Hancock must give more detail of any emergency powers he wants to bring in so that MPs \"can properly scrutinise\" the plans. Meanwhile, Lib Dem MP Layla Moran has written to the health secretary to urge him to make sure people are paid if they have to self-isolate, otherwise there could be \"devastating\" effects. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who will chair a meeting of the government's Cobra emergency committee on Monday, visited Public Health England's centre in north London on Sunday to discuss attempts to limit the spread of the virus. He said the virus was \"likely to spread a bit more\" but he was \"very, very confident\" the NHS would be able to cope with an outbreak. More than 200 British holidaymakers locked down at a quarantined hotel in Tenerife have been told they will be allowed to fly home, if they test negative for the virus.  The travellers have been quarantined at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel since Tuesday after four Italians contracted the virus. Some have already been allowed to leave but others are awaiting test results. The Foreign Office is in contact with operators and travel agents about their plans to return Britons to the UK. Globally, around 86,000 people have been infected, with cases in more than 50 countries. About 3,000 people have died - the vast majority in China's Hubei province, where the outbreak originated in December.  In other developments: Have you been affected by the coronavirus?

The number of confirmed cases also jumped in France, Germany and the UK, and the Czech Republic reported its first case. As the disease continued its rapid spread and governments introduced emergency measures to halt the progress of the escalating epidemic, outbreaks worsened in Iran and South Korea. The US also reported two new infections, one in Chicago and another in Rhode Island, marking the eastern state\u2019s first case. Italy said confirmed infections had risen 40% in 24 hours to 1,576, with the death toll now at 34. In Germany the number of people infected had almost doubled to 129 on Sunday, while France\u2019s total stood at 100 \u2013 up from 38 on Friday \u2013 nine of them in a serious condition. Iran meanwhile raised its death toll from 43 to 54 as its number of confirmed infections rose by more than half to 978, amid continuing concerns that official figures still do not reflect the full scale of the outbreak there. Iran\u2019s health ministry spokesman, Kianoush Jahanpour, said new cases confirmed in a number of cities, including Mashhad, home to Iran\u2019s most important Shia shrine, which has remained open despite calls to close. The escalating figures  came as the head of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned individuals in higher-risk groups to avoid crowds and other places of elevated infection risk. He tweeted: \u201cIf you are 60+, or have an underlying condition like cardiovascular disease, a respiratory condition or diabetes, you have a higher risk of developing severe #COVID19. Try to avoid crowded areas, or places where you might interact with people who are sick.\u201d And among a growing number of sites and events to fall victim to coronavirus fears was the Louvre museum in Paris, which shut on Sunday afternoon, reportedly after about 300 staff met in the morning and voted \u201calmost unanimously\u201d not to open. Louvre management later confirmed the museum was closed for the entire day, and said it would refund ticketholders. Both France and Switzerland, which banned mass gatherings \u2013 have cautioned citizens not use \u201cla bise\u201d \u2013 known to Britons as the \u201ckissy kissy\u201d greeting \u2013 for fear of spreading the virus. The Iranian figures represent 11 more deaths than reported on Saturday and 385 new cases of infections. While the new numbers have brought down the percentage of deaths to infections to about 5.5%, that is still much higher than other countries, suggesting the number of infections in Iran may be far higher. The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine. The UN agency\u00a0advises\u00a0people to: Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are divided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit \u2013 but not eliminate \u2013 the risks, provided it is used correctly. Justin McCurry Amid plans announced by the Revolutionary Guards to install mobile hospitals in the cities of Qom and Rasht, Iran\u2019s state broadcaster said all flights to and from Rasht, the capital of northern Gilan province, had been suspended. \u201cWe have set up centres across the country to help people to tackle the virus,\u201d an unnamed Revolutionary Guards commander told a televised news conference on Sunday. \u201cWe need national cooperation to tackle this crisis. People should follow our health officials\u2019 advice.\u201d After days of assurances that the virus was largely under control, officials recently acknowledged Iran was preparing for the possibility of tens of thousands of people getting tested for the disease. The figures from Iran, which along with China, South Korea and Italy has suffered the most serious outbreaks, came at the same time as an avalanche of worsening indicators outside China, where reported cases had appeared to be declining. However, despite recent indications that China, the worst affected country so far, might be turning a corner, on Sunday it reported the sharpest increase in new infections in a week with 573 additional cases and 35 deaths. The deaths represented a drop from the previous day\u2019s toll of 47. China has recorded a total of 2,870 deaths from 79,824 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei. In Italy, a top health official has warned of a \u201ctsunami\u201d effect on its hospital system after confirmed cases there rose to almost 1,700 including 34 deaths, a warning that has been increasingly echoed in other European capitals. \u201cThe situation is, frankly, an emergency from the point of view of health system organisation,\u201d Massimo Galli, a professor and director of infectious diseases at Milan\u2019s Sacco hospital, told Corriere della Sera on Sunday. His warning came as the US on Sunday urged Americans not to travel to the two Italian regions hardest hit by the new virus, raising the level of warning for the Lombardy and Veneto regions to the highest level. \u201cIt is the equivalent of a tsunami for the number of patients with major diseases being hospitalised all together,\u201d said Galli. \u201cFor example, on Friday, before the new wave of cases arrived in Lombardy, there were 85 beds occupied by patients intubated for Covid-19 \u2013 that\u2019s a significant share of those available.\u201d The pattern of rapid spread was also visible in South Korea, which reported a further 586 infections, taking the country\u2019s tally to 3,736 cases, with a death toll of 18. In a sign of the wider social impact of the outbreak, it was disclosed that the leader of a religious sect in South Korea could face a homicide investigation over some of the coronavirus deaths. The city government of the capital, Seoul, has asked prosecutors to charge Lee Man-hee, the founder of the Shincheonji church, and 11 others who are accused of hiding the names of some members as officials tried to track patients before the virus spread. That coincided with the decision by South Korea\u2019s Catholic church to halt masses at more than 1,700 locations nationwide for the first time in its 236-year history. Buddhist temples also called off events, while major Christian churches held online services. In France, meanwhile, travellers were advised to avoid journeys abroad outside the EU unless strictly necessary. The country has banned gatherings of more than 5,000 people in confined spaces and outside demonstrations in areas where the virus has been reported. Sunday\u2019s Paris half-marathon has been cancelled, while priests in some dioceses, including Paris, have been instructed not to put the host into communicants\u2019 mouths but into their hands instead. Among the new contaminations were three health workers at a Paris hospital and a firefighter in Rennes. In the Haute-Savoie region, where there has been a cluster of cases thought to have originated from a person who had returned from northern Italy, the mayor of La Balme-de-Sillingy, Fran\u00e7ois Daviet, announced he had tested positive.  New cases also included two children aged one year and five years who have been hospitalised in Strasbourg along with their 27-year-old mother who also tested positive. Their condition has been described as not worrying. Elsewhere, the US, Australia and Thailand have reported their first deaths, while two frontline doctors in China died and more countries banned large gatherings and imposed travel restrictions. A 35-year-old male retail worker in Thailand died from Covid-19, according to the country\u2019s department of disease control on Sunday. The man had also tested positive for dengue fever. In Australia, a 78-year-old man who was on the Diamond Princess cruise ship died in a hospital in Western Australia. His wife has also contracted the virus. Fears were mounting in the US, where the governor of Washington declared a state of emergency after a man died there, the country\u2019s first reported death. More than 50 people in a nursing facility in the state are ill and being tested for the virus. Governor Jay Inslee directed state agencies to use all resources necessary to prepare for and respond to the outbreak. The declaration also allows the use of the Washington national guard if necessary. The Israeli national airline, El Al, is reportedly considering firing 1,000 out of its total workforce of about 6,000 because of losses linked to the coronavirus outbreak. A company spokesman confirmed the plan to AFP but would not give further details.",

Tampa Weather Summary: 63 degrees 4 Weather Alerts TAMPA, Fla. \u2014 Update: A third person in Florida has tested 'presumptive positive' for COVID-19. The state is awaiting final confirmation from the Centers for Disease Control.\u00a0 Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Monday two people in Tampa Bay tested positive for the coronavirus, and he expected the number of cases to rise. According to the Florida Department of Health, there are now 247 people in the state being monitored for symptoms. This is a developing story. Stay with 10news for updates at\u00a0WTSP.com/coronavirus. Original story: The new coronavirus, which was first detected in China, has reached Florida. Gov. Ron DeSantis announced two cases of the novel virus had been confirmed in the Tampa Bay area. He, too, issued an executive order to declare a public health emergency in Florida and establish protocols for controlling its spread. Two people in Florida tested \"presumptively positive\" for COVID-19 during the weekend, including someone from Manatee County and someone from Hillsborough County. It was confirmed Monday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that the two people both, in fact, have coronavirus. They are isolated and getting medical attention. During a Monday morning news conference, DeSantis said the state is now monitoring 184 potential coronavirus cases\u00a0and there will likely be more positive cases. Still, state Surgeon General Scott Rivkees said the threat to the general public is \"still low.\"\u00a0 UPDATE:\u00a0Florida monitoring 184 potential cases of COVID-19; 'public risk is still low,' governor says RELATED:\u00a0US professor at the epicenter of coronavirus outbreak: 'Don\u2019t panic' The Florida Department of Health said the patient from Manatee County hasn't traveled to countries identified for restricted travel by the CDC. That person, described only as an adult, went and got medical care and is now isolated until public health officials give the all-clear. Medical professionals are working closely to monitor anyone who may have come into contact with the person. The second person -- a woman in her 20s -- is from Hillsborough County and had traveled to Italy, according to the Florida Department of Health. She is isolated and will continue to remain isolated until cleared by health experts. RELATED: Coronavirus: Answering the top 10 questions people have been Googling While the governor's office did not specify where the patients were being treated, a letter appearing to be from Doctors Hospital of Sarasota suggests a patient is there. The March 1 notice, which is printed on letterhead from Doctors Hospital, said the patient was admitted in late February and is still present. When the medical staff realized the patient might have coronavirus, the hospital reportedly activated COVID-19 protocols and identified everyone who had come in contact with the individual. The letter said the hospital was working with local and state health officials, along with the CDC, to make sure it was taking all possible precautions. \"There is no information we can provide at this time,\" the hospital said in a statement, which directed people to county health leaders. \"State Surgeon General Dr. Scott Rivkees has taken appropriate, decisive action to help affect the best possible outcomes, and I will continue directing our state agencies to do whatever is necessary to prioritize the health and well-being of Florida residents,\" DeSantis said. RELATED: Florida governor calls for public health emergency on coronavirus: What does that mean? The governor has instructed the Florida Department of Health to make its own determinations with regard to any quarantines and other possible public health interventions, as allowed under state law. \"Despite these cases in Florida, the overall immediate threat to the public remains low,\" a state health department spokesperson wrote in an email. People who are looking for more information on how to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and about how to protect themselves can visit the Florida Department of health\u2019s website. Additional useful information can be found on the CDC\u2019s website and the World of Health Organization\u2019s website. On the other side of the country, six people have now died from COVID-19 in Washington state. Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, coughing and shortness of breath. They may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days. Most people recover, although older people and individuals with underlying medical conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes are at a greater risk of developing a more serious illness.\u00a0 There isn't yet a vaccine for preventing COVID-19, so the best way to stay healthy is to limit your risk of being exposed to it. To stay safe from the coronavirus, health experts say you should wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60-percent alcohol. Avoid close contact with people who are sick, and stay home when you are sick. The CDC does not recommend healthy people without symptoms wear facemasks. Those should be reserved for people with symptoms -- to help stop them from spreading it to other people. They should also be used by health care workers, as necessary. Coronavirus is a family of viruses commonly found in a number of animals, including bats, camels, cats and cattle. Sometimes, though not often, according to the CDC, coronaviruses can spread from animals to humans. Other examples of this include SARS and MERS. These diseases cause everything from the common cold to pneumonia and more serious respiratory issues. This current outbreak is believed to have originated from a seafood market in the central city of Wuhan, China. Initially, it spread from animals to people. Since then, health officials have confirmed it can also spread from person to person. As of Feb. 11, this respiratory disease has been named COVID-19 (short for \"coronavirus disease 19\"). The virus that causes this disease is called \"SARS-CoV-2.\" The novel coronavirus has reached 12 states. On Sunday, New York's governor announced a woman in her 30s had contracted it while traveling to Iran. Her condition is not serious, according to the governor. There have been nearly 90 confirmed cases so far in the U.S. Around the globe, more than 87,000 people have been diagnosed -- and at least 3,037 people have died. As part of our 10News effort to focus on facts not fear, doctors warn the flu is still a much bigger threat than the coronavirus -- just based on the numbers.

The Rhode Island Department of Health announced early Sunday that the man,\u00a0in his 40s, recently had returned home after a trip to Italy, where cases of the coronavirus have skyrocketed in recent months.  Rhode Island Gov. Gina M. Raimondo said during a news conference that the risk for Rhode Islanders remained generally low and there was no need to panic or be frightened. The man, whose identity was not released, has had \u201climited travel\u201d in Rhode Island since returning from Italy, and has not returned to work, the Providence Journal reported.  Health Department officials said they have made \u201cextensive efforts\u201d to ensure that all those who had contact with the man would undergo a two-week period of self-monitoring for symptoms at home with public health supervision.  \u201cAs long as anyone exposed to the individual does not have symptoms outside of their home setting, the virus cannot spread to other people in the community,\u201d the Health Department announced.  The man\u00a0currently has been hospitalized and receiving treatment. The hospital was coordinating closely with the Health Department, the Providence Journal reported.

Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon weighs in on the coronavirus fears causing market selloff on \u2018Sunday Morning Futures.\u2019 \u201cWe are not widespread community transmission in Rhode Island, and the general level of risk for Rhode Islanders is still low,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, everyone in Rhode Island has a role to play in helping us prevent the spread of viruses, just like the flu. It is very important that people wash their hands regularly, cover their coughs and sneezes, and say home if they are sick.\u201d  Elsewhere over the weekend, the number of U.S. cases grew following reports of new infections in Illinois and at least two in Washington state, including a man in his 60s who was in critical condition. The news brought the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the Seattle area to six.

        "full_text": "135.6m shares A member of a council advising Iran\u2019s supreme leader has died after falling sick from coronavirus. He has become the first top official to succumb to the disease which is affecting members of the Islamic Republic\u2019s leadership, which has the highest death toll in the world outside China. Expediency Council member Seyyed Mohammad Mirmohammadi died aged 71 at a hospital in Tehran, according to state radio. As well as acting as advisers, the council also settles disputes between Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and parliament. Also among the country\u2019s infected officials is Iraj Harirchi, head of an Iranian government task force on the coronavirus who tried to downplay the virus before falling ill. Other high profile patients include Vice President for women and family affairs Masoumeh Ebtekar, better known as \u2018Sister Mary\u2019. The English-speaking spokeswoman for the students who seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and sparked the 444-day hostage crisis. Iran has reported 978 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus strain named Covid-19 and 54 associated deaths. Across the Middle East there are over 1,150 cases of the airborne bug, the majority of which are linked back to Iran. Experts worry the disease\u2019s mortality rate in Iran (5.5%) is much higher than in other countries, suggesting the number of infections may be much higher than current figures show. Health workers in the country reported that 210 people had died from the illness as of Saturday, five times more than government figures claimed. In a bid to stem the spread, Iran\u2019s Foreign ministry held an online-only news conference today in which spokesman Abbas Mousavi dismissed an offer of help by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Tensions between the two countries have been at their highest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution after an American drone strike in Baghdad killed top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani. This provoked an Iranian ballistic missile attack against US forces at a base in Iraq. At today\u2019s conference Mousavi said: \u2018We neither count on such help nor are we ready to accept verbal help.\u2019 He said Iran has always been \u2018suspicious\u2019 about America\u2019s intentions and accused the US government of trying to weaken the nation\u2019s spirits. Meanwhile the British Embassy has begun evacuations over the virus. A spokesperson for the UK\u2019s Foreign Office said: \u2018Essential staff needed to continue critical work will remain. \u2018In the event that the situation deteriorates further, the ability of the British Embassy to provide assistance to British nationals from within Iran may be limited.\u2019 While Iran has closed schools and universities to contain the spread of the virus, major Shiite Islam shrines have remained open despite civilian authorities demanding they be closed. WHO 'assuming' that coronavirus will continue to spread over summer Supermarkets say there's no need to panic buy as there's plenty of food Wash your hands all you want, but taking your phone to the toilet could be making you sick The virus has taken hold of the holy cities of Mashhad and Qom, where Shiites often show their faith by touching, kissing and licking the shrines, which authorities have been cleaning with disinfectant. Police ave arrested one man who posted a video of himself licking the metal enclosing the Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad, the most-important Shiite saint buried in Iran. In the clip the man said he was doing it to \u2018allow others to visit the shrine with peace of mind\u2019. The outbreak has been dragged into a years-long boycott of Qatar by four Arab nations over political disputes. A prominent columnist at Dubai\u2019s government-owned Al-Bayan newspaper on Twitter falsely accused the kingdom of unleashing the disease to sabotage the upcoming Expo 2020 world\u2019s fair in Dubai and Saudi Arabia. Three dead after suicide bombing outside US embassy 'Two school boys stripped disabled girl, 14, naked and raped her on school bus' Mother beheaded her daughter, 5, because the little girl asked her for cereal Noura al-Moteari later described the tweet as \u2018satire\u2019 after it gained widespread attention and the Dubai Media Office said the tweet was written in a \u2018cynical style\u2019. It added: \u2018Noura is a freelance writer and is not an employee of Al-Bayan nor does she represent the publication\u2019s views. \u2018That being said, this has no relevance to any social media policy being practiced by the publication nor the state.\u2019 The tweet comes after Qatar expressed disappointment on Sunday that nearly all of its Gulf neighbors snubbed invitations to attend the weekend peace signing ceremony between the U.S. and the Taliban.

JNS.org \u2013 Israel\u2019s Health Ministry confirmed on Saturday that seven Israelis have so far tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), aka \u201ccoronavirus.\u201d Thousands of Israelis are currently under quarantine following potential exposure to the virus. Three of the Israelis with COVID-19 returned from Italy last week. One of the returnees\u2019 spouses also has the disease. An additional two are under close supervision after being evacuated from the\u00a0Diamond Princess\u00a0cruise ship off the coast of Japan. The seventh Israeli, who was believed to have been cured after being taken from the\u00a0Diamond Princess\u00a0to a Japanese hospital, was released to Israel on Friday and subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. According to Israel\u2019s\u00a0Channel 12\u00a0news, Rambam Health Care Campus in Haifa and Barzilai Medical Center in Ashkelon were also preparing isolation wards to accept coronavirus patients. According to a report by\u00a0The Marker\u00a0over the weekend, as of Sunday 4,582 Israelis were under quarantine for possible exposure to the virus, including 294 students and 28 preschool children. However, the report indicates that flight records suggest the number should be at least 10,000, including all returnees from Italy in the past two weeks. \r\n\r\nCTech- Doron Shaziri was 20 years old when he lost his left leg to a landmine during a military operation... Israel\u2019s El Al Airlines announced the suspension last week of all flights to Italy, which has the highest rate of coronavirus infection in Europe at 640 cases, and of all flights to Thailand starting on Monday. Parents of girls attending the 600-student Rosary Sisters School in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City expressed concern that school administrators had not taken precautions after a group of 14 students who traveled to Italy for a Model United Nations conference returned to Israel, according to a Tazpit Press Service report published on Sunday. The girls were not quarantined after they returned, according to the report. The school\u2019s principal said she had not reported the children to the Health Ministry and was under no obligation to do so, according to the report. However, the school\u2019s director alleged that students wore masks and used disinfectants. As of Feb. 28, some 83,652 confirmed cases of coronavirus have been reported worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Israeli Science and Technology Minister Ofir Akunis announced last week that Israeli researchers at the Galilee Research Institute (MIGDAL) were as little as three weeks away from developing a coronavirus vaccine. The team, which created the vaccine against avian flu, has said that the genetics of the two viruses are very similar. The vaccine is expected to be distributed in oral form, enabling a much faster dispersal of the medication. get the best of the algemeiner straight to your inbox!

The Minister said the victim in question was a French national who entered the country aboard an Air Senegal flight on February 26. Nigeria is the other sub-Saharan African country with a positive case. The patient according to authorities lives in Senegal and flew back from France. He reported to a private hospital on 27 February with symptoms including a headache. The authorities are monitoring everyone who travelled on the same flight as well as the patient\u2019s family. The Minister underscored the country\u2019s preparedness for the situation. Senegal was one of few countries with the facilities to test for the virus very early on, along with South Africa and Ghana. The World Health Organization, WHO, has since boosted the capacity of a number of countries to test. Egypt meanwhile, the first African country to record a case, just recorded its second coronavirus case. The country\u2019s Health Ministry made the announcement on Monday. It said in a statement that the patient is a foreigner, but did not specify their nationality. The patient, who tested positive for the coronavirus with minor symptoms, has been quarantined at a hospital in Negeila, in the north of the country, the statement also said. This is the second case recorded in the country of 100 million people.  The first was declared cured on 27 February. Egypt\u2019s Health Minister said Sunday that 1,443 people had so far been tested for the coronavirus. Egypt\u2019s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has ordered stricter health control measures at the country\u2019s ports in an attempt to combat the coronavirus. Nigeria and Algeria are the two other African countries which have reported cases of the coronavirus, which has infected more than 89,000 people across 58 countries. ",

Sikka Regent Robby Idong declared an Extraordinary Occurrence (KLB) in relation to the dengue outbreak in January. Sikka Health Agency acting head Petrus Herlemus, said the KLB had been extended to March 2020, the third such extension since the KLB was first announced. Petrus also said the medical team in Sikka was now on 24-hour alert to handle incoming dengue patients. The Sikka administration has also requested 10 more doctors from the Health Ministry to help with the outbreak. Benediktus Lukas Raja, a Sikka Regional Legislative Council (DPRD) member, told The Jakarta Post that the Sikka administration had to take more serious steps to handle the outbreak. \u201cThere had been 11 dengue fever patients [who died]. We ask the administration and our friends at the Health Ministry to be more proactive,\u201d Benediktus said. He said the dengue fever response should involve all stakeholders, including the Health Ministry, community health centers (Puskesmas), village heads, subdistrict heads, village heads and community heads. He added that the Health Agency should make a master plan to handle other possible disease outbreaks, such as malaria and filariasis.\n\u201cPeople working in health care should not think that we have to be sick first to get treatment, instead they should think about how to minimize the number of sick people. There is no point building a luxurious health facility if the number of sick people keeps going up,\u201d he said. (gis) \u00a9 2016 - 2020 PT. Niskala Media Tenggara",

En la zona Este ahora de la Capital empez\u00f3 a reducir los infectados y ahora la zona de Norte es la que est\u00e1 en alerta epidemiol\u00f3gica. \u00a0El n\u00famero de infectados de dengue en La Rioja sigue en ascenso. As\u00ed lo confirm\u00f3 el titular de Epidemiolog\u00eda de la provincia, Eduardo Baz\u00e1n. En di\u00e1logo con Radio Nacional, el funcionario de la cartera sanitaria indic\u00f3 que hasta este lunes hay 97 casos confirmados de personas infectadas con dengue y otras 30 en estudio. Adem\u00e1s, reiter\u00f3 el pedido de extremar las precauciones de limpieza, deschatarreo y eliminaci\u00f3n de sectores donde se acumula agua. Por otra parte, Baz\u00e1n apunt\u00f3 que en los barrios de la zona Este de la Capital los trabajos de fumigaci\u00f3n comenzaron a dar sus frutos y la situaci\u00f3n comienza a controlarse pero ahora la zona que preocupa es la Norte. El dengue es una infecci\u00f3n v\u00edrica transmitida por la picadura de las hembras infectadas de mosquitos del g\u00e9nero Aedes. Hay cuatro serotipos de virus del dengue (DEN 1, DEN 2, DEN 3 y DEN 4). El dengue se presenta en los climas tropicales y subtropicales de todo el planeta, sobre todo en las zonas urbanas y semiurbanas. Los s\u00edntomas aparecen 3\u201314 d\u00edas (promedio de 4\u20137 d\u00edas) despu\u00e9s de la picadura infectiva. El dengue es una enfermedad similar a la gripe que afecta a lactantes, ni\u00f1os peque\u00f1os y adultos.El dengue grave es una complicaci\u00f3n potencialmente mortal porque cursa con extravasaci\u00f3n de plasma, acumulaci\u00f3n de l\u00edquidos, dificultad respiratoria, hemorragias graves o falla org\u00e1nica.  Las recomendaciones Limpiar, fregar y secar bien el interior de recipientes que pueden juntar agua. Tirar agua hirviendo en canaletas y rejillas. Adem\u00e1s cubrir las rejillas con tela mosquitera. Dejar dados vuelta los envases que pueden acumular agua. Evitar tener recipientes con agua acumulada. Renovar agua de floreros y mascotas cada 2 o 3 d\u00edas. Limpiar bien los portamacetas, para que asi se puede desterrar al mosquito transmisor de esta enfermedad.  Los s\u00edntomas\u00a0 Los s\u00edntomas m\u00e1s comunes son fiebre elevada (40 \u00b0C), dolor de cabeza muy intenso, dolor detr\u00e1s de los globos oculares, y dolores articulares y musculares; mientras que los signos de alarma del dengue, que demandan atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica urgente, son dolor abdominal intenso, v\u00f3mitos persistentes, respiraci\u00f3n acelerada, hemorragias de las mucosas, fatiga, irritabilidad y presencia de sangre en el v\u00f3mito. No hay tratamiento espec\u00edfico para el dengue (ni para el dengue grave), pero la detecci\u00f3n oportuna, el acceso a la asistencia m\u00e9dica y el manejo adecuado del paciente enfermo disminuyen las complicaciones y la progresi\u00f3n de la enfermedad hacia la gravedad. La muerte por dengue es casi siempre evitable. Nueva Rioja - Informaci\u00f3n + Opini\u00f3n Seguinos",

Fire crews responded to the scene in the 700 block of Willow Avenue about 4:10 p.m., according to Supervisor Miguel Ornelas of the Los Angeles County Fire Department. A mylar balloon struck a power line, which resulted in damage to a natural gas line and water line, according to Patrice Clayton of SoCalGas. SoCalGas crews stopped the gas leak by 7:30 p.m., and they were working on a permanent repair, Clayton said. No injuries were reported, but residents were not allowed back into the building Monday evening due to \u201csubstantial damage to utilities at the structures,\u201d according to LACFD Capt. Tony Imbrenda. A team from the American Red Cross provided support to residents displaced by the incident, Marilyn Jimenez Davila, a spokeswoman for the group, said. The affected homes remained uninhabitable, and those affected were still unable to return to their homes as of Tuesday evening, Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department Deputy Trina Schrader said. San Gabriel Valley Tribune staff writer Eric Licas contributed to this story. *UPDATE*  #WillowIC @socalgas personnel have successfully stopped gas leak at this location.

Eight of the new patients announced on Tuesday had recently travelled from Italy, and the fresh cases also included the first to have travelled from Germany. The others had been to Singapore, Japan and Iran, suggesting none are believed to have contracted the virus in the UK. Health officials in the Canary Islands reported the first case of a British national testing positive at a quarantined hotel in Tenerife. The 12 new UK cases constitute the second highest single-day increase in cases to date. They include the first known cases in Hampshire, Humberside and Northamptonshire. Others are from London, Wirral, Greater Manchester and Kent. Dr Will Welfare, of Public Health England North West, said there were three new Covid-19 cases in Greater Manchester, including two from Bury. \u201cAs a result of contact tracing we know the new Bury cases announced today are known contacts of the previously confirmed case from Bury,\u201d he said. \u201cThe third case is a resident of Bolton which is not linked to the two cases in Bury announced today. The Bolton resident became infected whilst in Italy. \u201cClose contacts will be given health advice about symptoms and emergency contact details to use if they become unwell in the 14 days after contact with the confirmed cases. This tried and tested method will ensure we are able to minimise any risk to them and the wider public.\u201d The previous case from Bury was said to have contracted the virus in Italy. Given that Public Health England (PHE) has said all the new cases were contracted after overseas travel rather than within the UK, the two latest cases from Bury are also likely to have travelled to Italy. Health officials in the Canary Islands said a woman who tested positive for coronavirus at a hotel in Tenerife on Monday is British and is now in hospital. The woman was one of 168 British tourists staying at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel when guests were placed in quarantine after Italian visitors who had recently stayed there tested positive for Covid-19. She is the sixth person at the hotel to test positive for coronavirus and the first Briton. On Monday, 148 guests left the 467-room hotel after they tested negative for the virus. PHE did not specify how many patients were in each of the other six areas with new cases on the daily list. It said contact tracing had begun. There have been 48 cases in England to date and one each in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland. As of 9am on Tuesday, 13,860 people in the UK had tested negative for coronavirus.",

Ron DeSantis, she said the governor \u201cconfirms a third presumptive #COVID19 case in Hillsborough; this individual resided with another who is confirmed as COVID-19.\u201d .@GovRonDeSantis confirms a third presumptive #COVID19\ncase in Hillsborough; this individual resided with another who is confirmed as COVID-19. Florida considers a case presumptively positive based on testing at one of the state\u2019s three labs, then awaits confirmation from the CDC in Atlanta. On Monday, Florida officials confirmed that two people had been infected with the novel coronavirus. One of the confirmed cases was identified as a man in his 60s from Manatee County who had not been to any of the countries currently identified for restricted travel by federal authorities, nor was he known to have been in contact with anyone who had traveled there. The second confirmed patient is a woman in her 20s in Hillsborough County who had recently traveled to northern Italy \u2014 one of the areas identified for restricted travel due to the virus. The presumptive third case lived with the woman in Hillsborough. DeSantis and other local officials on Monday said they were expecting more positive cases as more testing was conducted, and their focus was to contain its spread. As of Tuesday afternoon, 16 people in Florida who have been tested for coronavirus exposure were awaiting test results. There were another almost 250 under \"public health monitoring,\" which health officials defined as people under health official watch because they had contact with someone who tested positive, as well as people who have returned from China in the past 14 days. The governor said his primary concern is the health and safety of infirm and elderly people in nursing homes, and he urged facilities to restrict visitors. Meanwhile, facilities and organizations in the Bay area that attend to the needs of populations that appear to be especially vulnerable to the coronavirus, such as the elderly, are on high alert.\u00a0 \"It's very much about cleanliness, washing our hands, ensuring the time that we're doing it correctly and doing it right, how often we're doing it,\" said Nancy Clanton of Meridian Senior Living in Pinellas Park. The Diocese of St. Petersburg has also taken steps to protect the health of parishoners. Leadership of the diocese has left decisions such as suspending distribution of the chalice during communion or holding hands during services up to individual pastors. \"We don't want to cause panic or go to extremes but we want to be careful. We want to be cautious,\" said Father Gary Dowsey of Our Lady of Lourdes Parish. The spreading virus has placed health officials across the U.S. on high alert. The absence of a clear protocol for sharing information between states became more apparent Tuesday, as Florida officials expressed irritation that New York health officials did not reach out to alert them about a 50-year-old lawyer who traveled to Miami and later tested positive. Florida officials said they learned about the case through the news media. &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;",

The company added that the employee is being checked upon, along with that person\u2019s family members to ensure everyone is doing fine. \u201cThe colleague now has mild symptoms and is in good spirits,\" added the statement from DSM. Prior to this, apart from the infected 24-year-old software employee (admitted at Gandhi hospital), health department officials from Telangana also began screening about 50 others to test them for coronavirus (he is believed to have been in close contact with about 80 persons after he developed fever). Most of the samples have returned negative so far. DSM is located at Raheja Mindspace tech park in the heart of Hyderabad\u2019s IT corridor.

For the latest coronavirus updates from Thursday, March 5, please click here. Governments around the world are scrambling to contain the spread of COVID-19, which is growing globally even as transmission in China, where the virus originated at the end of last year, continues to show signs of slowing within the country. There are more than 93,000 cases around the world - the overwhelming majority in China - but as deaths are reported in Italy, Iran and the United States, authorities are considering new quarantine zones and travel restrictions. As the number of deaths rose in Iran and Italy, Poland, Morocco, Andorra, Armenia and Argentina all confirmed their first cases of the virus in the past 24 hours. This live updates page is now closed. For the latest coronavirus updates from Thursday, March 5, please click here. Here are the updates from - Professional football matches and other big sporting events will take place without fans present until April 3 said Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.\u00a0 The preventive measure is part of a new decree issued by the government hoping to prevent a further spread of the virus which has caused 3,089 infected cases and 107 fatalities in the country.\u00a0 Conte posted a five-minute video on his Facebook page, reassuring viewers and saying that the decree was a way of assuring \"responsible behaviour.\" He said banning crowds at sporting events would help \"prevent further opportunities of infection.\"  Iraq reported its second coronavirus death in the capital Baghdad, the health ministry said in a statement published by the state news agency. The health ministry added the patient had many chronic diseases. A Saudi national travelling from Iran through Bahrain tested positive for coronavirus, the health ministry announced in a statement published by the state news agency. It added that the man did not disclose at the border that he was coming from Iran and that he had interacted with the person who had the first case reported on Monday.  The ministry confirmed that the new patient is currently quarantined in hospital and all the people who interacted with him have been tested and the results will be announced once completed. US legislators reached a deal to provide $8.3bn in emergency aid to confront the novel coronavirus in a bipartisan effort, according to members of the House of Representatives.\u00a0 \"We must quickly enact this legislation - lives are at stake,\" said House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey who introduced the measure in the Democratic-controlled lower chamber of Congress.   Republicans in the Senate, the upper chamber, are also supporting the bill. US President Donald Trump already said that he would \"spend whatever is appropriate\".\u00a0 The House planned a vote later today to approve the emergency plan, sources told the New York Times newspaper.\u00a0 Algeria reported nine new confirmed coronavirus cases on Wednesday, bringing to 17 the total number of people tested positive for the virus, the health ministry said. The cases include 16 people from the same family in Blida province, some 30 kilometres south of the capital Algiers and an Italian man. The total number of cases in Sweden rose to 52 as new cases were registered in Stockholm.\u00a0 \"Sixteen additional patients were found infected with COVID-19 ...The infected patients are being cared for in isolation to reduce the risk of further transmission,\" Region Stockholm said in a statement. The causes of four of the 31 confirmed cases in the Stockholm region remain under investigation, as - unlike the rest of the cases - no clear link to infection abroad or contact with people who had been infected abroad had been found, the authority said. France has 285 confirmed cases of coronavirus said the head of the public health service Jerome Salomon, which is an increase of 73 compared to a day earlier. During a press briefing, he added the death toll from the disease was still at four and that 15 persons were in intensive care. French President Emmanuel Macron said he had an \"excellent\" discussion with his US counterpart Donald Trump.\u00a0 The talk took place in order to better deal with the coronavirus. \"We are ready to coordinate our scientific, health and economic response within the framework of the US G7 Presidency,\" Macron wrote on Twitter.\u00a0 Excellent discussion with @realDonaldTrump. To better deal with Covid-19, we are ready to coordinate our scientific, health and economic response within the framework of the US G7 Presidency. Two Iranian students tested positive for coronavirus in Hungary said its Prime Minister Viktor Orban. \"We have the first infected individual, or rather two right away, whom we had to hospitalise because of the infection,\" Orban said in a video on his Facebook page. \"They have no symptoms yet but the fact of the infection has been confirmed\".  All Italian schools and universities will be shut down from tomorrow until March 15 said Education Minister Lucia Azzolina.\u00a0 The preventive measure comes as the death toll from the outbreak of the coronavirus has risen by 28 over the past 24 hours to 107 according to the Civil Protection Agency with the contagion showing little sign of slowing.  The head of the agency said also that of those originally infected, 276 had fully recovered versus 160 the day before. As demand for ethanol-based sanitisers soars, producers of soju - South Korea\u2019s national drink - are offering to help. Soju is a distilled spirit with 17 to 20 percent alcohol by volume traditionally based on rice, but now often wheat and potatoes. \"Ethanol demand for disinfection has grown while supply is limited ... we have decided to provide it,\" an official from Daesun Distilling, based in the southeastern city of Busan, told Reuters news agency. To banish the virus, the company has pledged to donate 32 tonnes of ethanol for use in disinfecting buildings and public places in Busan and southeastern Daegu, the city at the centre of South Korea's outbreak. Whether used for liquor or disinfection, both have the same chemical structure and can break apart the virus particle according to an expert.\u00a0 Israel ordered travellers arriving from Germany, France, Spain, Austria and Switzerland to go into home quarantine over coronavirus concerns. The same measure was already in place with regard to flights from Italy, China and Singapore. Under the edict, the Health Ministry ordered all international conferences in Israel to be cancelled and banned gatherings of more than 5,000 participants. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also advised Israelis to stop shaking hands to help halt the spread of the virus. Iran banned top officials from leaving the country until further notice, ramping up efforts to limit the spread of the coronavirus.\u00a0 Iran has the highest number of government officials sickened in the contagion, including the vice president, the deputy health minister and 23 members of parliament.\u00a0\u00a0 Scientists in China studying the coronavirus say they have found that two main strains are circulating in humans and causing infections. However, the study looked\u00a0only at a limited range of data.\u00a0The researchers, from Peking University's School of Life Sciences and the Institut Pasteur of Shanghai under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said follow-up studies of larger data sets were needed to better understand the virus' evolution.  The preliminary study found that a more aggressive strain of the new coronavirus associated with the outbreak in Wuhan accounted for about 70 percent of analysed cases, while 30 percent were linked to a less aggressive type. The prevalence of the more aggressive virus type decreased after early January 2020, they said. A student in New York tested positive for COVID-19, marking the third case in the state. Yeshiva University said it was cancelling all classes at one of its four New York City campuses as a \"precautionary step\" while it worked with authorities on how to best prepare and keep its students safe. The university did not identify the student. The latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention listed 108 confirmed and presumed cases in the US.\u00a0 A pet dog of a coronavirus patient in Hong Kong was confirmed to be infected with the disease, in a likely case of human-to-animal transmission, local authorities said.   The city's Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said repeated tests suggest the dog has \"a low-level of infection\".\u00a0The canine, which belongs to a 60-year-old woman patient, was quarantined at an animal centre.\u00a0   The AFCD said experts from universities and the World Organisation for Animal Health have unanimously agreed that \"it is likely to be a case of human-to-animal transmission\".   All pets of people in Hong Kong infected with the coronavirus will be quarantined for 14 days, starting Friday. Two dogs are already in isolation. Qataris will not be allowed to enter Egypt starting March 6 amid fears over the coronavirus, according to the Egyptian government. The ban includes those with a valid residency. Qatar and Egypt are on opposite sides of a regional rift and Cairo said it was responding to a similar measure taken by the Gulf state. \"In light of what Qatar has decided regarding prohibiting entry for travellers holding Egyptian nationality ... as part of the precautionary measures to face the coronavirus, [we have] decided to implement the principle of reciprocity,\" the cabinet said, adding the measure would be in place until further notice. Qatar imposed a temporary restriction on entry to its territory on visitors from Egypt via intermediate points because of the virus' spread. The ban did not specifically mention Egyptian nationals. The number of people testing positive for coronavirus has jumped to 85 in the UK after 16,659 people were tested across the country, said the UK Department of Health and Social Care.\u00a0 UPDATE on coronavirus (#COVID19) testing in the UK:   As of 9am 4 March 2020, a total of 16,659 people have been tested:   16,574 negative.  85 positive.

He told ministers the country's FSB security service reported to him that false information was being planted to create panic, while in reality the situation is not critical. \"As for these provocative fake stories, the FSB reports they're mainly organised from abroad ... The aim of such fake stories is clear: to spread panic among the public\". He said Russia had to fight this by releasing \"timely, comprehensive and trustworthy information\". The official total of confirmed cases in Russia is six so far. The London Book Fair, one of the world's biggest publishing trade fairs has been cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak.\u00a0 \"It is with reluctance that we have taken the decision not to go ahead with this year's event,\" read a statement published by the fair's organisers, adding that the decision falls in line with the UK government guidelines and follows the advice of public health authorities.\u00a0 pic.twitter.com/RTwhbli8GA Iran's President Hassan Rouhani dismissed a US offer to help the Islamic republic fight its coronavirus outbreak, charging that \"vicious\" American sanctions were depriving the country of medicine.  The US offer comes as the novel virus has affected almost all of Iran's provinces, claiming 92 lives out of 2,922 confirmed infections in the past two weeks. \"Those who have deprived the people of even medicine and food through sanctions, who have done the most vicious things ... they appear with a mask of sympathy and say that we want to help the nation of Iran,\" Rouhani said, in a clear reference to the US. US President Donald Trump had said on Saturday he was ready to aid Iran with the virus outbreak if the Islamic republic asked for assistance. The most visited museum in the world reopened its doors after it closed on Sunday due to virus fears. However, workers voted overwhelmingly to resume work.\u00a0 \"The Louvre Museum is open\" read the latest tweet from the French museum's official account.\u00a0 Mercredi 4 mars : le mus\u00e9e du #Louvre est ouvert.   Wednesday March, 4: the #Louvre is open. pic.twitter.com/nY1vTjTB9P Management presented a raft of new anti-virus measures to coax employees back to work.\u00a0Among them: wider distributions of disinfectant gels and more frequent staff rotations so employees can wash their hands. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO, is stepping up his effort to fight against virus-related misinformation.\u00a0 \"We're focused on making sure everyone can access credible and accurate information,\" Zuckerberg said in a post on his Facebook account. \"Given the developing situation, we're working with national ministries of health and organizations like the WHO, CDC [US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]\u00a0and UNICEF to help them get out timely, accurate information on the coronavirus,\" Zuckerberg posted, adding that the WHO will be given free advertising.\u00a0  Friday prayers in Iran have been cancelled across all provincial capitals amid the country's growing coronavirus outbreak, state television said. Friday is the main congregational day of prayer in Islam and traditionally an important event for Iran's clerical rulers. The announcement comes as Tehran and other areas cancelled Friday prayers last week over the outbreak. A group of 17 Italian tourists taken to a quarantine facility in New Delhi have tested positive for the coronavirus.\u00a0 The group entered India before the country began screening passengers from Italy. Their Indian tour bus driver was also found to be infected. India has confirmed 28 cases of the coronavirus as of Wednesday, up from an earlier figure of five. The Italian government is preparing new emergency measures such as closing schools and universities across the country in a further attempt to contain the worst coronavirus outbreak in Europe. A draft decree seen by Reuters spelt out the draconian steps, ordering \"the suspension of events of any nature ... that entail the concentration of people and do not allow for a safety distance of at least one metre to be respected\".   A government source told Reuters that schools and universities will also be closed nationwide, though this was not in the decree seen by the news agency and the education minister said the decision had not yet been finalised.  Saudi Arabia has temporarily suspended Umrah pilgrimages to the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina for Saudi citizens and the kingdom's other residents over coronavirus concerns, the state news agency SPA said. The decision will be reviewed regularly and reversed when the situation changes, SPA said, citing an official source in the Saudi interior ministry. Iran's health ministry said the coronavirus has killed 92 people, up from 77 the day before, while the number of infections rose to 2,922.\u00a0 Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour announced the new figures at a news conference in the capital, Tehran. The virus has sickened top leaders within the Islamic Republic\u2019s government. Iran stands alone in how the virus has affected its government, even compared to hard-hit China, the epicentre of the outbreak. Malaysian authorities announced 14 new cases of the coronavirus, adding that the spike\u00a0was the result of a second wave of infections that began late last month. \"After 11 days of no reported cases, a second wave (of infections) began on the 27th February 2020,\"\u00a0Noor Hisham Abdullah, director-general of Malaysia's health ministry,\u00a0told a news conference in Putrajaya.   \"This makes the total cases of COVID-19, so far, 50 cases, while 22 of them have been discharged,\" he said.  Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said the outbreak of novel virus has affected almost all of Iran's provinces. \"This disease is a widespread disease,\" he said, according to the official presidency website.\u00a0  \"It has reached almost all our provinces and in one sense it's a global disease.\" COVID-19 has killed 3.4 percent of cases globally, a figure far above the seasonal flu's fatality rate of below 1 percent, according to the WHO. But the global spread of the new virus can still be controlled.  Read more here. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased to 240, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) said.

The Chinese Medical Association has said the median incubation period of the new coronavirus is five to seven days and the maximum 14 days. Speaking at a press event in Beijing, Du Bin, chairman of the Critical Care Medical Branch of the Association, also said that while in Hubei province some individuals tested positive for the virus even after being discharged from hospital after treatment, there is no data tracking such cases. He added there was no evidence yet that such patients can transmit the virus - which originated in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, late last year - to others. Gulf countries have responded to the coronavirus outbreak by introducing travel bans, stepping up screening measures at entry points and rescheduling - in some cases cancelling - significant sports and cultural events. Read more about the measures taken by Gulf countries aimed at curbing the spread of the virus here. Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd said it is developing a drug to treat high-risk individuals infected with the coronavirus. The Japanese company said in a statement it is also studying whether its currently marketed and pipeline products may be effective treatments for infected patients. \"As a company dedicated to the health and well-being of people around the world, we will do all that we can to address the novel coronavirus threat,\" Rajeev Venkayya, president of Takeda's vaccine business, said in a statement.

Russia has suspended the export of surgical masks and medical gear, including bandages and one-use chemical protection suits, according to a government resolution, amid fears over the spread of the coronavirus. It added that the suspension would not affect exports being made for humanitarian reasons. Russia has not reported any confirmed cases of people contracting coronavirus while inside the country, though six people who got infected elsewhere have received or are receiving treatment in Russia. \"It is mainly necessary to prevent a so-called 'artificial deficit' in certain medical items - masks, respirators, antiviral agents that speculators can export abroad,\" Industry Minister Denis Manturov said.

        "full_text": "\nNEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. (CBSNewYork) \u2013 The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in New York has grown to 11, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday. Also Wednesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio said a New York City public school teacher is under self-quarantine after showing symptoms of the virus. Nationwide, California reported its first death due to coronavirus. Eleven people have now died, ten of them in Washington state. While Westchester County was just getting news that a 50-year-old New Rochelle man and his family tested positive for coronavirus, along with the neighbor who drove him to the hospital, there were startling development late Wednesday afternoon. Cuomo now says another friend, his wife and three children have also tested positive. \u201cA friend of the lawyer who spent time with and in close proximity with the a number of situation that person also tested positive. We then tested that person\u2019s wife, two sons, and daughter, and they all tested positive,\u201d Cuomo said. The wife and daughter of the New Rochelle patient were asymptomatic even though they tested positive, Mayor Bill de Blasio said. Westchester County Executive George Latimer is urging everyone to remain calm. Watch: Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Westchester Officials Discuss Additional Coronavirus Cases In NY  \u201cThere is a spread of a contagious virus. There\u2019s also the spread of of misinformation and the spread of fear. And we may not be able to control what happens to a virus but we can control that spread of misinformation and fear,\u201d Latimer said. The New Rochelle man, first in Westchester to contract the disease, is hospitalized. Under mandatory self-quarantine are his wife, a 20-year-old son who is a student at Yeshiva University in Washington Heights, and a 14-year-old daughter at SAR High School in Riverdale. The neighbor, the friend and now his family are also required to stay in their home for 14 days. \u201cFor the people that have tested positive for coronavirus that you have asked to self-quarantine, how is that being policed?\u201d asked CBS2\u2019s Hazel Sanchez. \u201cThat is a mandatory quarantine situation,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cSo that\u2019s basically on the honor system?\u201d Sanchez asked. \u201cNo, no, no. That is policed. That is monitored and that is policed. We check on those people and make sure they are doing it,\u201d Cuomo said. The Westchester County Health Department says its staff is coordinating with the state to make sure people infected don\u2019t violate the mandatory quarantine. \u201cWe do reach out to people it depends on their situation and what we\u2019ve asked them to do. We may be calling or Skyping them. It depends on the level of security that\u2019s required,\u201d said Westchester County Health Commissioner Sherlita Amler. As a precaution, SAR High School will be closed until March 10. SAR Academy, Yeshiva University and Young Israel of New Rochelle will be closed until Friday. Students and members of the synagogue are being asked to self-quarantine through Friday. Schools in the Hastings on Hudson District will close Thursday and Friday to sanitize all of the buildings. All school activities will be canceled on Monday, March 9. CBS2 has been told they\u2019re doing this out of an abundance of caution. Mount Vernon City School District announced they are also closing all school buildings and offices for cleaning and disinfecting after learning two students have been quarantined for possible exposure to coronavirus.  \u201cIt is an imperfect science. Especially when you have a situation like this one. Or you have a person that may have contacted so many people. But you do the best you can again, trying to contain, trying to contain,\u201d Cuomo said. The governor says the Manhattan health care worker, first to test positive for coronavirus, is recovering well at home. Her husband tested negative. Though his test results are negative, city officials say they are treating him as a positive result, and are requiring quarantine. De Blasio said disease detectives had identified two people \u2013 a roommate and a close friend \u2013 that warrant testing for coronavirus at Yeshiva University. Results of those tests are pending at Bellevue Hospital. The infected man, believed to have gotten coronavirus through community spread, was in severe condition on Wednesday morning and is the first person in the New York area to be hospitalized due to the disease. \u201cHe has an underlying respiratory illness. So when we talk about the vulnerable population here \u2013 senior citizens, immune compromised, or an existing underlying illness, especially an underlying respiratory illness because this is a respiratory disease \u2013 this gentleman fits in that category,\u201d Cuomo said. Cuomo said that 80% of people who get the virus will \u201cself resolve,\u201d and the remaining 20% may need medical intervention. The lethality rate of coronavirus, he said, was around 1.4%, roughly double the flu rate. \u201cWe have an epidemic caused by coronavirus. But we have a pandemic that is caused by fear,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cI think in this case people are suspect about what they\u2019re hearing because government now is so polarized in so many ways, the environment is so political, that you hear different messages about this situation. And then it gets politicized.\u201d Cuomo said he expects the number of confirmed cases will continue to grow. \u201cIf you understand the facts, there is no reason for undue anxiety,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cThere are going to be dozens and dozens and dozens of people. And the more people you test, the more people you\u2019re going to find.\u201d Watch: Mayor Bill de Blasio, NYC Officials Update On Coronavirus  Cuomo also said that CUNY and SUNY students who were participating in study abroad programs in China, Italy, Japan, Iran and South Korea were being recalled. They\u2019ll return on a chartered plane and be quarantined in dormitories for 14 days, Cuomo said. The New Rochelle man works as an attorney at Lewis and Garbuz, P.C. in Manhattan. He\u2019s a member of Young Israel of New Rochelle, which will be closed through March 8. Five hundred to 700 people who attended services there on Feb. 22 and 23 have been told to self-quarantine through Sunday. Westchester County Executive George Latimer announced a hotline for those who had attended the Young Israel events with that patient: 1-866-588-0195.  \u201cThis is a very emotionally trying time for us all. When we first heard of the coronavirus it seemed so remote. It has now come not only to our doorstep, but has pierced our lives. Clearly, this entire episode is frightening and difficult, but let us not lose sight, however, that we are following the procedures mandated by our state\u2019s health department to try to prevent the spread of this virus. That is a sacred obligation that we all must take very seriously,\u201d Rabbi Reuven Fink of Young Israel of New Rochelle wrote on Facebook. Officials are also monitoring seven employees at the law firm and an intern there. They are all undergoing testing. Five are being tested in New York City and one in New Jersey. The remaining two are also being tested. The Lawrence Hospital, which is the first hospital that the lawyer went to, is having eight employees tested, Cuomo said. The NYPD says five officers who recently traveled to affected areas are also self-quarantined. The Department of Consumer Worker Protection has formally declared that there is a shortage of face masks in New York City, which means they can now fine stores if they\u2019re price gouging. Anyone who believes a store is price gouging is urged to call 311. Meanwhile, on Long Island, Nassau County officials want residents to know they are preparing for the coronavirus outbreak, including working on getting local testing. Watch: Nassau County Officials Preparing For Coronavirus Outbreak \u2014  \u201cThe ability to test locally, I think, would help speed up the process and also be very reassuring to our residents,\u201d Nassau County Executive Laura Curran said. \u201cWe feel we\u2019re as prepared as we can be, and we\u2019re ready to manage those individuals who may come into the hospital or help wherever we can,\u201d NuHealth Board Chariman Robert Detor said. There are no confirmed cases in Nassau County.window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\"licenseKey\":\"103fa8ca15\",\"applicationID\":\"144794115\",\"transactionName\":\"ZwdaZBdUX0VTVEBRC15NeVMRXF5YHV5aXAFI\",\"queueTime\":0,\"applicationTime\":274,\"atts\":\"S0BNEl9OTBoQVhYCH00f\",\"errorBeacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\"agent\":\"\"}",

Tests carried out post-mortem showed the man, who died on Feb. 13, was killed by the virus, regional health chief Ana Barcelo told a press conference. News of the death came shortly after\u00a0Spain's Health Ministry announced on its Twitter page that several sporting events would be held behind closed doors, while medical conferences will be cancelled in an effort to limit the spread of the virus. The ministry said sport fixtures expected to draw crowds from zones designated as high-risk for coronavirus, such as northern Italy, would be played without spectators, having earlier referred to the measure as a recommendation. Such events include the return leg of the Champions League match between Valencia and Italy's Atalanta scheduled for March 10, and a Europa League match between Getafe and Inter Milan on March 19. Several basketball games will also be affected. In total, around 150 people have been diagnosed with coronavirus in\u00a0Spain, while some 100 health workers in the Basque region have been isolated in their homes after coming into contact with people carrying the virus. Authorities are monitoring two clusters of the infection in Torrejon de Ardoz, a suburban city close to Madrid with a population of around 130,000, and one in the Basque city of Vitoria-Gasteiz. \u00a0 \u00a9 2016 - 2020 PT.
