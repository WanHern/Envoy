The patient is a male in his 30s who has been hospitalized in Bergen County since March 3. A sample tested by the state Department of Health came back positive. The sample was pending confirmation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) but was being treated as confirmed. State officials are \u201cworking aggressively to keep residents safe and contain the spread of COVID-19 in New Jersey,\u201d Gov. Phil Murphy said in a statement. COVID-19 is the disease caused by the new virus, SARS-nCoV-19. According to Judith Persichilli, the state\u2019s health commissioner, most New Jersey residents are at a very low risk of contracting the new illness. The state Department of Health previously said New Jersey was preparing for a \u201cpotential outbreak\u201d of the virus. Officials said state residents should follow guidance from the CDC and state Health Department to contain the spread of COVID-19. The CDC recommends people prevent the illness by avoiding close contact with sick people, not touching one\u2019s eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands, and washing hands frequently. People who are ill should stay at home. Other recommendations include covering a cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throwing the tissue in the trash, and cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces using a cleaning spray or wipe. Americans should prepare for significant disruption to their lives, including having plans in place in case their workplaces or children\u2019s schools close or are limited by outbreaks of the virus. Employers should encourage sick employees to stay home and consider letting people work from home if possible. Some areas have begun discouraging large public events. The CDC is also recommending that people avoid traveling to parts of the world most affected by the new virus, including China, Iran, South Korea, and Italy. There are 100 confirmed cases now in the United States, Vice President Mike Pence, head of the Coronavirus Task Force, told reporters on Wednesday night. That doesn\u2019t include the people evacuated from Japan or China who have become ill since returning to America and being quarantined at military bases. Most of the cases are on the West Coast, in California or Washington state. The virus first emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has spread to over 50 countries. The virus primarily spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. There are currently no vaccines or proven treatments, though many patients have recovered through rest and medical care. About four out of five patients don\u2019t require hospitalization, according to international health experts. Of the nearly 100,000 people who have tested positive for the virus worldwide, around 3,000 have died. While New Jersey reported its first case on Wednesday, neighboring New York reported a sharp increase in cases, including family members of a man who lives in Westchester and works in the borough of Manhattan. Nine people in contact with the man tested positive, including his wife and children and several neighbors. Officials said about 1,000 people were asked to self-quarantine and monitor themselves for symptoms of the new virus. Symptoms are similar to those for the flu and include fever and a dry cough.\",\"reports\":[{\"syndromes\":[],\"diseases\":[\"Fever of unknown Origin\",\"Influenza-like illness\",\"sars\",\"COVID-19\",\"Acute fever and rash\",\"other\"],\"locations\":[{\"location\":\"Trenton, NJ\",\"country\":\"United States\"}],\"event_date\":\"2020-03-05 00:24:00\"}]}]",

The COVID-19 illness causes mild or moderate symptoms in most people, but severe symptoms are more likely in the elderly or those with existing health problems. More than 89,200 people have recovered so far, mostly in China.

CENTCOM spokesman Capt. Bill Urban made the announcement. Urban says the sailor returned to the U.S. from overseas travel on March 15 and went into precautionary quarantine at his home. He didn't stop at CENTCOM or at Macdill Air Force base, where the command is located in Tampa.  The sailor started developing symptoms on Wednesday, called ahead to Macdill health officials, and was met outside the base by doctors. Officials say his test returned positive on Friday.  ___  ROME \u2014 Italy's health minister is pleading with people to follow the rules.

Germany's official Robert Koch Institute listed 16,662 case and 47 deaths, but officials have acknowledged that their count lags behind figures provided by regional health authorities.  Some German states, such as Bavaria, have stepped up measures to contain the outbreak by further restricting the reasons people can leave their homes. That\u2019s prompted some criticism about stricter curfew measures.  ___  ISTANBUL \u2014 Turkey is suspending flights to 46 more countries, the transport ministry announced, bringing the number of banned flights to 68 countries.  The interior ministry banned picnics and barbecues, expanding measures that included the closure of cafes, bars, schools and communal prayers. The official Anadolu news agency says restaurants would have to set up tables one meter (3 feet) apart. The agency also reported send-off gatherings for new soldiers would temporarily be banned.  At least 670 people have tested positive for COVID-19 and nine people have died.  ___  LONDON \u2014 The London tourist sites were eerily empty on Saturday, a day after the government ordered the closure of all bars, restaurants, movie theaters and other places where people congregate. Pigeons outnumbered people in the usually bustling Trafalgar Square and Leicester Square.  Parks filled with people strolling and jogging on a cool, sunny spring day, and business continued at the outdoor Portobello Road market -- though produce-sellers and some shoppers wore masks and gloves.  There were long lines outside some supermarkets. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is meeting with supermarket executives over the weekend about how to keep the shelves filled.  ___  JOHANNESBURG \u2014 A few African heads of state have defied coronavirus-related travel restrictions to attend Namibian President Hage Geingob's inauguration.  Angola closed its air, land and sea borders this week, but Namibian media showed President Joao Lourenco at Saturday's ceremony. Also in attendance was President Mokgweetsi Masisi of neighboring Botswana, which this week suspended international travel by all government employees.  Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa was there. He announced a national disaster even before his country confirmed its first virus case on Friday.  Confirmed cases in Africa have totaled more than 1,000.  ___  NICOSIA, Cyprus \u2014 A Cyprus police spokesman says authorities have turned away a boat carrying around 100 migrants, citing government directives banning the entry of foreign nationals to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.  Christos Andreou told state-run Cyprus News Agency on Saturday that police patrol vessels approached the boat as it was nearing the country\u2019s southeastern coast late Friday and told passengers that they couldn\u2019t disembark because of the ban. Andreou said the passengers, who were offered food, water and fuel, initially refused to change course, but eventually sailed away.  The spokesman said the chief of police has ordered stepped-up patrols around Cyprus\u2019 coastline as well as along the 120-mile-long United Nations-controlled buffer zone that separates a breakaway Turkish Cypriot north from the internationally recognized Greek Cypriot south.  Meanwhile, Turkish Cypriot police said a boat carrying 175 Syrians that included 69 minors and 30 women landed on the shores of the Karpas peninsula in the pre-dawn hours Saturday. They were taken to a sports hall for a medical check-up. The Cypriot government accuses Turkey of channeling migrants to Cyprus, especially through the north.  ___  MADRID \u2014 Spain has recorded almost 5,000 new coronavirus infections in 24 hours as it climbed into third place in the global ranking of infections behind China and Italy.  Health authorities said Saturday that virus infections have reached 24,926, up from 19,980 the day before. Total deaths were 1,326, up from 1,002 on Friday. Over 1,600 patients are in intensive care units that authorities admit are at their limits. Madrid is the hardest hit region with almost 9,000 infections.  Spain is approaching one week of tight restrictions on free movement and the closure of most shops as hospitals and nursing homes buckle under the burden of the virus outbreak. But authorities admit that they expect infections to continue to rise before the measures can hopefully reverse the trend.  ___  MOSCOW \u2014 A deputy mayor of the Russian capital says workers are laboring around-the-clock to build a center that can treat hundreds of coronavirus victims, and that completion is expected within a month.  Placards in the style of Soviet propaganda posters have been placed at the site, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) outside Moscow's center, exhorting builders to work at maximum speed; one shows Mayor Sergei Sobyanin pointing at the viewer and the slogan \\\"Builders \u2014 Minutes count!\\\"  Deputy Mayor Andrei Bochkarev said Saturday that the new facility will be able to accommodate up to 500 patients. Russia so far has recorded 253 cases of coronavirus infection.  ___  BERLIN \u2014 Germany's southwestern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg is opening its hospitals to patients from the neighboring region of eastern France that's struggling with a surge of infections with the new coronavirus.  A spokesman for the state's health ministry confirmed a report Saturday by the daily Schwaebische Zeitung that governor Winfried Kretschmann has offered assistance to France amid a growing shortage of ICU beds there.  Markus Jox said authorities have asked all hospital in Baden-Wuerttemberg with free capacity to take in French patients requiring ventilators.  Jox said that while the state's own capacity is limited and there are already some bottlenecks, \u201cwe will naturally try to help our French neighbors.\u201d  ___  LONDON \u2014 Britain lags behind Italy, Spain and France in the spread of the new coronavirus, but already the country\u2019s overstretched health system is creaking.  The U.K.\u2019s state-funded National Health Service has about 4,000 critical-care beds and some 5,000 ventilators, and officials say that's far fewer than will be needed as the number of cases spikes in the coming weeks.  On Thursday, a London hospital temporarily declared a \u201ccritical incident,\u201d meaning it could take no more critically ill patients. Unpublished NHS figures seen by The Guardian say the number of confirmed of suspected COVID-19 patients in intensive care in south London rose from seven on March 6 to 93 on March 17.  Engineering firms and automakers are stepping in to manufacture ventilators, and the government says it is shipping large supplies of protective equipment to hospitals. But some medics say they do not have confidence that they will receive the equipment they need to treat patients and keep themselves safe.  ___  BANGKOK \u2014 The governor of Bangkok has ordered the city's popular shopping malls to shut down except for their supermarkets and pharmacies to combat the spread of the coronavirus.  The malls' restaurant outlets are also allowed to operate, but only for takeout and delivery orders. Convenience stores, as well as food stalls and traditional standalone markets selling fresh food, can keep operating.  Other venues in the Thai capital now ordered closed from Sunday until April 22 include swimming pools, golf courses, tattoo parlors and cockfighting rings. Public and private schools and colleges, movie theaters, gyms and bars were already ordered closed.  The latest restrictions come as Thailand announced 89 new confirmed coronavirus cases, bringing its total to 411.  ___  THE HAGUE, Netherlands \u2014 The Dutch military is stepping in to help transfer coronavirus patients from the hardest-hit region in the Netherlands to hospitals elsewhere in the country.  Defense Minister Ank Bijleveld tweeted that military logistics specialists will be deployed Saturday to help with transfers between hospital intensive care units.  The decision to deploy the military came after hospitals in the hard-hit Brabant region of the southern Netherlands said they are struggling to cope with all the cases.  The head of infection prevention at the Amphia Hospital in the city of Breda Jan Kluytmans told national broadcaster NOS that \u201chospitals in Brabant can\u2019t handle on their own the stream of patients we expect in the short term.\\\"  The Netherlands has confirmed around 3,000 coronavirus cases, including 106 deaths.  ___  ATHENS, Greece \u2014 China has sent 18 tons of medical supplies to Greece, including hundreds of thousands of surgical and protection masks.  An Air China flight landed in Athens on Saturday morning bringing in the supplies. They include 8 tons of equipment donated by the Chinese government, among them the 550,000 masks, and 10 tons donated by Chinese businesses and organizations.  China's ambassador to Greece, Zhang Qiyue, said her country will do anything it can \\\"to help our friends in Greece.\\\" She also commended Greece for the \\\"timely and strong\\\" measures it has taken to limit the spread of the new virus.  Greece has confirmed at least 495 coronavirus cases, including 10 deaths.  ___  PRAGUE \u2014 South Korean automaker Hyundai's car plant in the Czech Republic and Kia\u2019s factory in neighboring Slovakia have closed their production lines, bringing a key part of both countries' economies to a standstill.  Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Czech in Nosovice won\u2019t reopen until at least April 6 as a preventive measure against the coronavirus outbreak.  Kia is joining its affiliate Hyundai in closing the plant near the Slovak city of Zilina.  In the Czech Republic, Skoda Auto, which belongs to Germany\u2019s Volkswagen Group, and Toyota Peugeot Citro\u00ebn Automobile, a joint project of Japan\u2019s Toyota and France\u2019s PSA, already suspended production earlier in the week.  The remaining three big car factories in Slovakia have been doing the same, including plants belong to Volkswagen, PSA and Jaguar Land Rover.  ___  JOHANNESBURG \u2014 The number of coronavirus cases in Africa has topped 1,000, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Angola reported its first cases, and Burkina Faso\u2019s foreign minister announced he is infected. At least 40 of Africa\u2019s 54 countries now have confirmed cases.  The Ivory Coast said it would close its borders starting Sunday, while Ethiopia\u2019s electoral authorities were discussing the possible impact on a national election later this year.  ___  DILI, East Timor \u2014 The tiny Southeast Asian country of East Timor has reported its first confirmed case of the new coronavirus.  The interim health minister said Saturday that a foreign national who had returned from abroad tested positive and has been put in quarantine.  East Timor, which gained independence from Indonesia in 2002, has a population of 1.3 million.  ___  ISTANBUL \u2014 Turkey's president has released an audio message urging all citizens, especially the elderly and the chronically ill, to not leave their homes, take care of personal hygiene and maximize social distance to combat the coronavirus.  A senior Turkish official says President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s public announcement was forwarded to all phone companies and will reach citizens through automated calls. It is part of an effort to raise awareness among the elderly who may not have access to online information. The message was also shared on social media.  At least 670 people have tested positive for the coronavirus in Turkey and nine people have died.  ___  SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea\u2019s prime minister has \u201cstrongly recommended\u201d that the country\u2019s religious facilities, gyms and clubs close for the next 15 days to help stem the spread of the coronavirus.  Chung Se-kyun said in a nationally televised speech Saturday that the government plans to use administrative orders to shut down the facilities that remain open but fail to enforce proper distance between people.  He said the government could also file damage claims against churches and businesses that become linked to infections after failing to employ preventive measures.  South Korea\u2019s epidemic has slowed, but there are growing concerns about a steady rise in infections in the Seoul metropolitan area, home to about half of South Korea\u2019s 51 million people.  ___  The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
